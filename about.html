			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Giolee has rendered oil spill response and clean-up services to reputable clients in the oil and gas industry. Some of the projects sites includes offshore, swamp and land locations with hydrocarbon contamination at varying depths. Our projects also involve shoreline clean-up and systematic mangrove vegetation cleaning.
			Oil  spills can cause a wide range of impacts which most times has direct consequences to the marine environment. In a major incident, the short-term environmental impact may be severe, causing serious distress to the ecosystem and the people living near the contaminated coastline, affecting livelihoods and impairing their quality of life.</p>
			<p>The selection of the most appropriate clean-up techniques requires a rapid evaluation of the degree and type of contamination, together with the length, nature and accessibility of the affected area.

Clean-up operations are often considered in three stages:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Stage 1 – Containment(Emergency phase): Collection of oil floating close to the environment and pooled, bulk oil ashore.</li>
    <li>Stage 2 – Recovery phase: Removal of stranded oil and oiled material.</li>
    <li>Stage 3 – Polishing phase:  Final  clean-up  of  light contamination and removal of oil stains, if required.</li>
</ol>
<p>Giolee Global Resources has capacity to mobilize equipment, personnel and resources at short notice to any spill location / environment.</p>
